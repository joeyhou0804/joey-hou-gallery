                    <small class="text-muted"><p>This is a set of paintings drawn independently for the Individual Creative Project of Masterpieces of Western Art, an art humanities course provided at Columbia University.</p>
                        <p>This creative project contains four paintings to convey the first impressions on a few essential ideas in the history of western art, including the Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, and Cubism. Each painting uses Chinese characters, which are the translation of the corresponding idea, to depict specific art ideasâ€™ critical characteristics. The English version of the art idea used and its Chinese translations, both in the traditional and simplified form, are included in all four paintings. The whole project shows not only new understandings towards the western art history from classes but also the idea of participating in a diversified and multicultural world by applying western art ideas on Chinese writing systems. All four paintings are designed and drawn independently by using Procreate, a designing iPad app.</p></small>
